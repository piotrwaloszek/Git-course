    <h2>A Girl</h2>
    <h5>by Mezra Pound</h5>
    <p>The tree has entered my hands,<br>
        The sap has ascended my arms,<br>
        The tree has grown in my breast-<br>
        Downward,<br>
        The branches grow out of me, like arms.<br>
        <br>
        Tree you are,<br>
        Moss you are,<br>
        You are violets with wind above them.<br>
        A child - so high - you are,<br>
        And all this is folly to the world.<br>
